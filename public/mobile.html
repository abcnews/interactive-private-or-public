        <p>Would you send your children to a public school or a private school? First, you decide — then we'll try to convince
          you that you're wrong.</p>
        <a name="endheader"> </a>
        <p>Not everyone has the means to choose a school for their kids. But for those who do, it can be a fraught decision.</p>
        <p>Making the perfect choice is impossible but by thinking about your child and your family, you can at least make a
          good choice.</p>
        <p>To help you understand what's at stake, tell us which way you're leaning and
          <strong>we'll give you a reason to change your mind</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Do you really get what you pay for? </h2>
        <p>If parents and all other taxpayers are pouring money into the education of private school children, then the academic
          results must be streets ahead. Only, they're not.</p>
        <p>There is a
          <a href="/news/mobile/2015-04-14/study-finds-no-academic-edge-for-private-school-students/6390936" target="_self" title="">growing</a>

            target="_self" title="">body</a> of

            target="_self" title="">evidence</a> to suggest that the type of school does not make much difference to scores if socio-economic differences
          are taken into account.</p>
        <p>David Gillespie, author of Free Schools, says that the most important things are good teachers and a good principal,
          and they can be found in public schools too.</p>
        <p>"Non-government schools do have more money than state schools and in some independent schools, that money makes its
          way into the pockets of better performing teachers and more administration staff but more commonly, all that extra
          dosh ends up in new buildings. Whatever's happening to the dough, it isn't changing educational outcomes at the
          individual level."</p>
        <p>Recent research suggests if you really want to encourage your child to excel at school, you should consider
          <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/comment/putting-down-your-phone-or-tablet-can-help-your-child-at-school-20171205-gzz4li.html"
            target="_self" title="">putting down your smartphone and picking up a book</a>. And it's a lot cheaper than private school.</p>
        <a name="private">
        </a>
        <h2>Even if you did get better results, is it really worth the cost?</h2>
        <p>Have you ever actually added up how much you'd fork out to put your kids through school?</p>
        <p>Australian Scholarships Group - a not-for-profit organisation that facilitates savings plans for parents -
          <a href="https://asg.com.au/calculator/cost-of-education-calculator" target="_self" title="">estimates the various costs involved</a> in sending your children to a public vs private school. </p>
        <p>Its

            target="_self" title="">current estimate</a> for putting a child born in 2018 through private school (in a city) is $475,342. </p>
        <p>Because it's not just fees to consider. What about uniforms, the latest textbooks, a tablet/laptop, school shoes,
          and transport?</p>
        <p>Think of all the
          <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/money/private-v-public--an-educated-guess-20110412-1dbok.html" target="_self" title="">other things</a> you could do with that much money:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>go overseas</li>
          <li>pay for tutors</li>
          <li>give them a deposit for their first place</li>
          <li>pay their HECS fees</li>
          <li>buy a house in an area that has better public schools</li>
          <li>invest in shares or property</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>So you're ok with a public education 'death spiral'?</h2>
        <p>Over the past few decades, the make-up of government and non-government secondary schools has shifted. </p>
        <p>They once had roughly the same proportions of students from low-income and high-income families, but now government
          schools have
          <a href="http://www.barbaraprestonresearch.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013-BPreston-Report-for-AEU-Social-make-up-of-schools-.pdf"
            target="_self" title="">almost twice the proportion</a> of students from low-income families compared to high-income families, and vice
          versa for non-government schools. </p>
        <p>Economics editor at The Age, Peter Martin, says public schools
          <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/comment/why-electricity-prices-are-set-to-climb-ever-higher-20170919-gykx0w.html" target="_self"
            title="">are now in the same 'death spiral'</a> as electricity companies, private health funds and the NBN: people who can
          afford to leave keep leaving, making the service worse/more expensive for those left behind.</p>
        <p>"They're losing the good students, leaving behind those that are harder to teach, making classes harder to teach
          and encouraging still more good students to leave. It's not only the electricity industry that wants a way out."</p>
        <p>Social commentator and author Jane Caro, who sent her children to public school, says
          <a href="http://www.mamamia.com.au/jane-caro-australian-education-funding/" target="_self" title="">the situation is all wrong</a>:</p>
        <p>"We can't keep asking some schools and some teachers to fix the problems of inequality, mental health, substance
          abuse and generational poverty on their own and then blame them when they can't — particularly as we currently
          ask them to do it on the smell of an oily rag."</p>
        <p>And this increasing segregation isn't helping our standard of education.</p>
        <p>Compared to Canada, our school students are more socially divided. Even though our economies and societies are quite
          similar, Canada regularly outperforms us on international league tables such as

          <a href="http://www.compareyourcountry.org/pisa/country/AUS?lg=en" target="_self" title="">isn't preventing our results from sliding</a>, so why are we still doing it?</p>
        <a name="private"> </a>
        <h2>So you think Gonski 2.0 will fix funding?</h2>
        <p>Australia's move towards a "needs-based, sector-blind" funding system has been a long time coming, and now we have
          new federal legislation that should - in theory - go some way towards addressing the imbalance. </p>
        <p>But does it?</p>
        <p>The Federal Government is spending an extra $18.6 billion over 10 years, in a boost to public and private school
          funding. </p>
        <p>It is now locked-in to providing 80 per cent of the School Resource Standard to private schools, and 20 per cent
          of the SRS to public schools. </p>
        <p>This means it is now up to the states to shift their funds and ensure that private schools aren't overfunded and
          public schools underfunded (state governments are now required to provide 75 per cent of government school SRS
          and 15 per cent of non-government school SRS).</p>
        <p>Economist Trevor Cobbold of Save Our Schools says Commonwealth Education Department data predicts
          <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/h02bie/New%20Data%20Confirms%20More%20Private%20Schools%20Will%20be%20Over-Funded%20Under%20Gonski%202.0.pdf"
            target="_self" title="">the number of overfunded non-government schools will skyrocket under the new funding arrangements</a>.</p>
        <p>"Gonski 2.0 is a goldmine for private schools. It is the best special deal they have ever had," he
          <a href="entrenches-structural-incoherence-and-inequity-in-school-funding" target="_self" title="">said</a>.</p>
        <p>"In contrast, virtually all public schools will remain underfunded even though they enrol over 80 per cent of disadvantaged
          students across Australia ... unless there is a dramatic change in state government funding policies."</p>
        <p>So by sending your child to a private school, you're still backing a system in which non-government schools receive
          much more federal funding per student than government schools. Is that ok with you?</p>
        <a name="private"> </a>
        <h2>It'll be good for their character.</h2>
        <p>A lot of time and resources are devoted to
          <a href="http://www.education.vic.gov.au/documents/about/department/resiliencelitreview.pdf" target="_self" title="">building resilience</a> in children these days. Are you really doing your kids a favour by putting them in an environment
          that will hold their hand all the way through school?</p>
        <p>Non-government schools do have a reputation for expecting excellence, and the argument is that this spurs kids on
          to achieve more. But what if you want to raise a self-starter?</p>
        <p>Writer Rebecca Douglas, who went to a Western Sydney government school, believes that doing it a bit tougher than
          other kids has been good for her.</p>
        <p>"Public school can foster a hunger and self-reliance private school kids have likely not had to strive for to get
          ahead," she
          <a href="/news/mobile/2013-07-29/douglas-did-public-school-kids-ever-have-a-chance/4850542" target="_self" title="">writes</a>.</p>
        <p>We've all heard the arguments about private schools opening up networking opportunities, but
          <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-are-middle-class-parents-looking-for-in-a-school-50278" target="_self" title="">what about the ability to socially adapt</a>?</p>
        <p>Public schools expose kids to a greater mix of people, building up their social skills and preparing them for life
          in an open society.</p>
        <a name="private"> </a>
        <h2>So, do you go to church?</h2>
        <p>The latest Census
          <a href="/news/mobile/2017-07-12/australia-religion-census-2016-mapped/8660798" target="_self" title="">showed</a> the category of "no religion" was a more common answer than every other religion or Christian denomination
          for the first time. But Australians continue to send their children to religious schools in huge numbers. </p>
        <p>Schools run by religious institutions come with mandatory religious studies and they understandably come with a focus
          on worship.</p>
        <p>They also have the right to discriminate based on their values, meaning staff can be terminated for no other reason
          than being gay, or remarrying after divorce.</p>
        <p>If that doesn't line-up with your family's beliefs, can you turn a blind eye?</p>
        <p>Apart from religious philosophy, it's important that the school's core values roughly line up with those of your
          family. If values such as diversity and acceptance are important to you, how well do you think your chosen school
          would celebrate them?</p>
        <a name="private"> </a>
        <h2>How convenient is the school you've chosen?</h2>
        <p>As of 2016, there were more than twice as many government schools in Australia than non-government schools, so chances
          are your closest school is a public one.</p>
        <p>Travelling adds time to your kid's school day and makes it less likely that their friends will be from your area.</p>
        <p>As kids become teenagers, they start wanting to stay up later, and sleep in later. They aren't being lazy, it's how
          they’re wired.</p>
        <p>Getting enough sleep is important for a whole range of health reasons. If you’re closer to a local high school, your
          teenager will probably get more sleep, avoiding very early starts.</p>
        <p>A recent study
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/upshot/the-economic-case-for-letting-teenagers-sleep-a-little-later.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0"
            target="_self" title="">linked later high school start times to better economic outcomes</a>. </p>
        <p>"The growing evidence is that forcing adolescents to get up so early isn't just a bad health decision; it's a bad
          economic one, too," says Indiana University professor of paediatrics Aaron Carroll.</p>
        <p>You probably can't easily convince the education department to start school later, but you could conceivably do the
          same thing for your child by choosing a school that's easier to get to, allowing a bit of extra kip before breakfast.</p>
        <p>Plus, don't you spend enough of your time in the car already?</p>
        <p>The
          <a href="/news/mobile/2017-09-13/how-to-save-on-household-expenses/8936088" target="_self" title="">latest ABS stats</a> say Australians are spending 14.5 per cent of their weekly budget on transport. </p>
        <p>If you already live close to a decent public school, why spend extra time and money getting to a private school further
          away?
        </p>
        <a name="public"> </a>
        <h2>I'm choosing a state school</h2>
        <a name="public"> </a>
        <h2>Why wouldn't you give your child the best you can?</h2>
        <p>A succession of funding decisions by federal governments means that private schools have the ability to provide better
          technology, newer buildings, bigger swimming pools, and sometimes attract better teachers. </p>
        <p>For many parents, these differences (visible and perceived) are key to sending their children to private school.
        </p>
        <p>"Some of the parents I studied were contemplating private schools with twice the level of resources per student,
          and more than ten times the spending on capital works (including five times more capital funding from government)
          than the nearest public secondary school,"
          <a href="https://theconversation.com/school-choice-no-great-love-for-the-private-path-but-parents-follow-the-money-40376"
            target="_self" title="">says Associate Professor Joel Windle</a>.</p>
        <p>"This extra funding is reflected in sporting and music programs and state-of-the-art science facilities."</p>
        <p>Does your child have a particular talent or interest that could be encouraged by better resources? Why not (literally)
          aim for the skies? One private high school in Brisbane recently
          <a href="https://www.bggs.qld.edu.au/observatory/" target="_self" title="">opened its own observatory</a>. </p>

        <h2>It's not what you know, it's who you know</h2>
        <p>These days,
          <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4221.0" target="_self" title="">35 per cent</a> of parents are choosing to send their child to private school. Although this percentage appears
          to have stagnated, it's still a significant number of people, and overwhelmingly made up of higher income families.
        </p>
        <p>Have you thought about what advantages your child could gain from making connections with others who are likely to
          become future leaders?</p>
        <p>Even if you like the idea of your child getting to mix with people from all walks of life at school - maybe to toughen
          them up or teach them empathy - you might not like the thought of them missing out on opportunities because of
          where they went to school.</p>
        <a name="public"> </a>
        <h2>What kind of job will they be suited to?</h2>
        <p>If you think your child might go into a profession, it's worth thinking about having a reputable school on their
          resume as they start their working life.</p>
        <p>Consider this scenario,
          <a href="/news/mobile/2013-07-29/douglas-did-public-school-kids-ever-have-a-chance/4850542" target="_self" title="">relayed</a> by public school graduate Rebecca Douglas after a conversation with a couple of lawyer friends:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>My friend's firm had been inundated by applications and had chosen to filter them by insisting on grades of at
            least a distinction average (fair enough) and by eliminating all the public school applicants, regardless of
            merit (very much
            <em>not</em>). Apparently the reasoning was that private school kids would likely have connections that could benefit
            the firm. My other friend chimed in to say that her employer had taken the same approach.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It's not clear how widespread this sort of prejudice is, but given that a third of the population is going to private
          schools, how certain can you be that your child will not get pushed aside by unconscious bias from a potential
          boss who didn't go through the public system?</p>
        <a name="public"> </a>
        <h2>Not every family is the same. </h2>
        <p>If you are a religious family, the cost of private school might be worth it simply to know that your child is spending
          their days in an environment that is more likely to reflect your values and give them a deeper understanding of
          your chosen faith. </p>
        <p>Or perhaps you believe in the value of a particular educational philosophy. Have you checked out the curriculum on
          offer, and whether it suits your child's strengths?</p>
        <p>The
          <a href="http://www.isq.qld.edu.au/choice-and-diversity" target="_self" title="">independent schools network</a> says their range of schools include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Non-denominational schools</li>
          <li>Schools with church or ethnic affiliations. For example, Lutheran, Anglican, Baptist, Jewish and Islamic schools</li>
          <li>Montessori schools</li>
          <li>Steiner schools</li>
          <li>Schools supporting Students With Disability</li>
          <li>Special Assistance Schools</li>
          <li>Schools for Indigenous students</li>
          <li>Schools with programs for gifted and talented students</li>
          <li>Schools that offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma</li>
          <li>Schools that cater for international students</li>
        </ul>
        <a name="public"> </a>
        <h2>It's all about the teachers and principal.</h2>
        <p>Educational philosophy is not the only area in which non-government schools are more independent. Have you thought
          about the school's ability to have greater control over staffing?</p>
        <p>Karen Spiller, former principal of St Aidan's girls' school in Brisbane, says school teachers and the quality of
          school leadership are crucial.</p>
        <p>"Definitely teachers make the difference. The research is absolutely clear," she
          <a href="http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/author-david-gillespie-challenges-the-notion-that-paying-big-bucks-for-elite-private-schools-guarantees-a-better-education/news-story/e0f1eedd19f8763ea60129d40a34a7bc"
            target="_self" title="">told Brisbane's Courier Mail</a>.</p>
        <p>"We talk about the difference that a quality teacher can make to a child and you are literally talking about an 18-month
          difference between a quality teacher and a teacher who is underperforming.</p>
        <p>"Independent schools have the ability to manage their own site in the way they want to and generally speaking I suspect
          are able to exert greater control over their staffing.</p>
        <p>"Recruitment selection of staff is absolutely vital in terms of making sure you have got a professional staff ...
          The mentoring and coaching of staff and putting out high expectations and making sure you are engaging in the conversation
          of teaching and learning on a day-to-day basis, is absolutely vital."</p>
        <a name="public"> </a>
        <h2>Does your child need a bit of a push?</h2>
        <p>We're not all suited to academia, but we need to at least get through school to have a shot at many of life's opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>If your child isn't particularly focused when it comes to school work, think about the advantages of being in an
          environment where they are expected to achieve.</p>
        <p>Many parents look for schools that provide rules and discipline, with an expectation that their students will be
          neatly presented and well-behaved. If your child could do with some structure at school, will they get that from
          the school you've chosen?</p>
        <p>If push comes to shove, when you're paying for a service you're more entitled to ask for value for money.</p>
        <a name="public">
        </a>
        <h2>Private schools are cheaper for taxpayers, so you should fork out.</h2>
        <p>The
          <a href="http://isca.edu.au//wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ISCA-Snapshot-2016-A4-2pp.pdf" target="_self" title="">average funding per student</a> from all government sources (2013-14) for government schools was $16,180, compared
          to less than $10,000 for non-government schools.</p>
        <p>The gap has been narrowing in recent years, but the non-government school sector argues that it is still cheaper
          for governments to financially support their schools than to educate those children through a state system. </p>
        <p>Many non-government schools, especially Catholic schools, are low-fee. If you can afford the fees and there's a suitable
          non-government school in your area, why not send your kids to a private school?</p>
        <a name="public"> </a>
        <h2>Are you exercising your right to choose? </h2>
        <p>Schooling might seem like just another decision to make, in a world where we are presented with too much choice.</p>
        <p>But did you know that the right to choose your child's type of education is part of the
          <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/" target="_self" title="">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>?</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>(3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In Australia, not only do we have public education available free to all, but a strong non-government school sector
          backed up by taxpayer dollars.</p>
        <p>Under the latest education funding changes, the Commonwealth has promised to provide 80 per cent of the Student Resource
          Standard; it's now the law. </p>
        <p>So your local private school is strongly backed by the richest government in the land, while the public school relies
          on often cash-strapped state governments for 80 per cent of their SRS. </p>
        <p>Which one looks like a more solid choice?</p>

        <h2>That's it!</h2>
        <p>The important thing is to remember there is no perfect choice, but you can use the tools at your disposal to make
          a good choice: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Go to open days, meet the principal. </li>

            of parents are using the site.</li>
          <li> Use your social network. Think about a child similar to your own. How did going through the school help or hinder
            them?
          </li>
